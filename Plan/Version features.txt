--Version 1.0 features
1.Authentication and authorization 
If the login system is designed so that we only register a team, 
we may have a problem with the same user in two or more teams,
so each user must be registered and only then be a member of the team. 
2. Players send a message by phone to a specific number in the form:
     -> Team name
     -> A place represented by your team
     -> Player names (player's year of birth)
     -> Main contact phone number (if you do not put this we will consider this one 
        by default)
3. SuperAdmin menu
      ->Approves the team
      ->CRUD operations on Teams, Reports, AllChallenge tables,Events, TeamInEvent, VoteOnWaiting
      ->Opening new event, SuperAdmin have full control over the event
4.Event 
  4.1 The administrator sets the start and end time of the event, 
      during which time users cannot create new teams.
  4.2 When the time of the event starts, a new options for event 
      opens up to the teams:
                            1> Send a result (all members of a teams sends results 
                            after match, this message will stand 3 days 
                            after the end of the match and based on the answers, 
                            app will assign the winner, and if it is 50-50 the 
                            referee comes and regulates the match)
                            2> Challenge other team 
                            3> Your team is challenged 
                            4> Statistic 
                            5> How much time until the end of the event,
                               and with how many teams you still need to play 
                               in your location
  4.3 The team accepts, rejects and sends challenges to other teams
  4.4 The event will be divided into a few parts if needed, for example:
      -Teams have a time period for which they should play matches, after that time the 
       event stops and points are calculated who reached the top 5, IF some teams have 
       the same score and not all of them are in the top 5, the event will be restarted 
       but only for those teams that have the same score and they will have a couple of 
       days to play the match between themselves and whoever wins enters the top 5, this
       principle will be repeated until all the teams in the top 5 are established 
5.Reports, each team can submit a report. A team can send a report only 
  once for the same team.
6. Voting logic:
   ->The team cannot send or receive a new challenge if it has not previously registered
     who won the last game

--Future versions

1. Inivite system, steps on how the user will form a team(due to future versions): 
   1> In the right corner of the screen, the user will have a message
      "wait for approval", when the administrator approves, the option 
      "be part of the team" will pop up for the user, 
      this option will exist until the event starts
   2> When the user clicks on that option, a drop-down menu appears where the
      user has 2 more options, create a team and join the team (where they will 
      receive a call from a team that has already been created)
2. User captains
